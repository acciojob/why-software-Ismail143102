  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I have always been fascinated by how technology works and how it can solve real-world problems. I enjoy creating things and seeing my ideas come to life through code. Software development allows me to be creative, think logically, and continuously learn new things. I believe this field gives me the opportunity to build useful tools that can make a difference in people's lives and improve the way we interact with the world around us.
